# React-Custom-SVG-Icon-Color-Picker

This is a small React project to showcase:

1. Passing props to child components.
2. Using onChange to monitor an input for value changes.
3. Passing a function through state to retrieve updated input value from a child component.
4. Using the value change to alter css of an fontawesome svg icon and background.

The projects uses React, ReacDom, FontAwesome, and Babel.
